Extracts following features using the Mouse-dynamics-challenge datset:-

1)Clicks per second: This feature can help us to detect whether the user is a bot or human by checking if the frequency of clicks is in achievable human range.

2)Average click time: This feature will check the user on the basis of click time, how much time has been taken by the user to click.

3)No. of clicks: It gives the number of clicks in the whole session.

4)Average mouse speed: This feature quotes the average cursor speed, can be compared with average speed range of a human user.

5)Average drag speed: It highlights the speed of the cursor while dragging.

6)No. of drags: This feature tells the number of drags in the whole session.

7)Averge drag length: It tells the average length for which user has dragged an object.

8)Average drag time: Average time taken by a user to drag an object, can be checked against feasible range of a normal human user.
 
The above mentioned features can be used to detect if a user is a bot or not at an initial stage. I will keep updating this list of features. These features have been extracted using initial 10 data files in "user12" only.
